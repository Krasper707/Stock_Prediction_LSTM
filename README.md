# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project predicts Axis Bank stock prices using an LSTM-based deep learning model. The model is trained on historical closing prices to forecast future trends.

## 🚀 Overview
This project follows a time series forecasting approach using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The process includes:

 ✔ Data Collection: Fetching Axis Bank's historical stock data.
 
 ✔ Preprocessing: Normalizing the closing prices and creating sequences.
 
 ✔ Model Training: Using an LSTM model to learn stock market patterns.
 
 ✔ Prediction & Evaluation: Assessing the model’s accuracy and visualizing forecasts.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Stock Price Forecasting: Predicts future closing prices of Axis Bank.

✅ Time Series Processing: Uses LSTM to model stock price trends.

✅ Data Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted prices for performance evaluation.

## 🏗 Model Architecture

✔ LSTM Layers: Two stacked LSTM layers for time series learning.

✔ Dropout Layers: Helps prevent overfitting.

✔ Dense Output Layer: Predicts the next closing price.
